# Automated_classification_of_consumer_goods

“Marketplace” is planning to launch a new e-commerce platform where sellers can showcase products to potential buyers through photos and descriptions. Currently, sellers must manually assign a category to each item, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. This raises the question: Can we automate the categorization of items into different categories with a high level of accuracy?

The mission of this project is to conduct a feasibility study for developing an automated classification engine. This system would categorize items based on a combination of their image and textual description, enabling sellers to assign categories accurately and efficiently. However, standard machine learning models struggle with this type of data as there are no readily usable algebraic features in images and text. Therefore, a critical part of the project will involve creating custom features specifically tailored for image and text data to achieve reliable performance in classification.
